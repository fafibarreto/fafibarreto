## Hi, Welcome 

### About myself

I'm in the process of developing to become a web developer and I believe in the power of education.
I graduated in Event Management, this world of events is constantly changing, in this process I discovered the world of women in technology,
it caught my attention because it is an area dominated by men.
 Now I'm on this journey and qualifying to become a developer and be part of this world of women in IT.
